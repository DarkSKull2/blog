# Hello World!

Everyone knows that software people can not start anything without an '_**Hello World!**_'.

This is the first and introductory post of **The Grumpy Portuguese Software Engineer**.
Just to make it clear, there is no direct correlation between **Grumpy**,
**Portuguese** and **Software Engineer**, I personally know many:
* Happy Portuguese
* Happy Software Engineers
* Happy Portuguese Software Engineers


As the years pass by,
my memory is not the same anymore,
I am not sure if it is the effect of the age itself,
or the brain kind of getting even for every time I said "_this is the last pint_" and it was not,
or due to the fact that I experienced the joy of fatherhood recently and
it came with many sleepless nights...  
the **why** it is not clear,
but it is clear that the my memory it is not as great as it was.


To avoid sharing the destiny with *Sisyphus* carrying the same rock up the hill for eternity,
I decided to write here the problems and thoughts that torment me,
it will not fix anything but when I came across with same issue,
instead of repeating again all the process in my mind,
iterating by all the crazy ideas and options in my head,
I can just jump to the conclusion "***Embrace the suck...***" ...
