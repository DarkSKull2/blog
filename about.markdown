# About Me
I am Portuguese,
I suffer from chronic resting bitch face and
have been working as as Software Engineer since I left university in 2011.

I had the pleasure to work in several companies, I like to think about myself
as a wee bee buzzing from flower to flower, where the companies are the flowers
and the knowledge and experience I carry is the pollen in this absurd metaphor.

# About The Blog
This Blog is to write down reflections on problems and straight thoughts that haunt my mind.

Hoping that the process of crystallizing them as text helps develop new ideas
and perspectives, the so called _rubber duck effect_ on steroids.

**This is not the place to find solutions**.  
This is intended to discuss ideas and thoughts in the spirit of achieving a
better understanding and comprehension of the problems.
